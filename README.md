Overview In this assignment, you will take on the critical role of   a cybersecurity consultant   tasked   with   advising   the   board of   directors of   a leading healthcare organization. Your mission is to conduct   a comprehensive   assessment of   their cybersecurity risk landscape and develop   a robust mitigation plan rooted in industry   standards and best practices.To begin, you will   select   a   specific   sector within the healthcare industry,   such   as   hospitals,   clinics,   or   pharmaceutical   companies,   and delve   into   a recent,   high-profile   cyberattack that   occurred within that   sector.   Through   meticulous   analysis,   you   will   identify   the   assets   affected,   the   threat   actors   involved,   the   vulnerabilities   exploited,   and   the   tactics,   techniques,   and   procedures   (TTPs)   employed   by   the   attackers.   This   comprehensive understanding   will provide   invaluable   insights   into   the potential risks   faced by your client.Next,   you   will   conduct   a   thorough   risk   assessment   for   the   Metropolitan   Integrated   Health   System   (MIHS),   drawing   on   insights   from   your   industry   research   and   the   MIHS   case   study.   Your   task   is   to   identify critical assets within MIHS, potential vulnerabilities, and at least five   distinct   cyber risks   they   could encounter. For each risk, you will evaluate its likelihood and impact using risk matrices, aligning   your assessment with the ISO 27005      framework.   Additionally, you will assess      the broader   consequences   of these   risks,   encompassing   business   operations,   brand   reputation,   customer   loyalty,   regulatory compliance, and   staff   morale. To clarify   the   specific   cybersecurity   objectives   under   threat,   you will map each risk to the CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity,   and Availability.Based   on your   assessment,   you will   develop   a   tailored mitigation   strategy   that   directly   addresses the   severity and potential impact of   each identified risk. This    strategy    should encompass    technical,   operational, and governance controls, supported by thorough cost-benefit analyses to justify   investments. To ensure alignment with industry best practices, you will structure your strategy   according to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) functions (Identify, Protect, Detect,   Respond,   Recover, govern) and relevant categories/subcategories.Furthermore, you will leverage the lessons learned from the real-world attack case   study to   emphasize   the   relevance   and   effectiveness   of your   proposed   measures.   In   addition,   you   will   suggest   specific   actions MIHS could have taken to prevent or minimize the impact of   the attack, incorporating security   design principles such as least privilege, defence in   depth,   secure   defaults,   and   fail-safe mechanisms.Remember,   the   core   cybersecurity   objectives   are   confidentiality   (protecting   sensitive   data),   integrity   (ensuring   data   accuracy   and   reliability),   and   availability   (guaranteeing   access   to   critical   systems   and   data). Your proposed mitigation   strategies   should not only align   with   these   objectives   but   also   adhere   to critical design principles to strengthen the healthcare organization's overall   security posture.
Case: Metropolitan Integrated Health   Systems (MIHS)Metropolitan Integrated Health   Systems (MIHS), a major healthcare provider in a bustling urban area,   was   renowned   for   its   state-of-the-art   facilities   and   comprehensive   medical   services.   The   morning   of   June   15, 2023, brought an unforeseen crisis that would   shake the institution to its   core.MIHS    operated    a    complex    IT      network,      spanning      multiple    buildings      and      encompassing      various   departments, including the main hospital, an outpatient clinic, a research facility,   and   a   dedicated   data   center.   This network   supported   a wide   array   of critical   systems   and   applications   essential   for patient   care, administrative functions, and research activities.Despite   its   technological   advancements,   MIHS   faced   significant   challenges   in   maintaining   a   robust   cybersecurity posture.   The IT   infrastructure was   a heterogeneous mix of legacy and   modern   systems,   with   some   departments   having   recently   upgraded   their   technology   while   others   continued   to   rely   on   outdated   software and hardware.   This mix created potential   vulnerabilities   that   could be   exploited   by   malicious actors.The main hospital housed   emergency   services,   operating rooms,   and   inpatient   care units.   It   relied   on   an   Electronic   Health   Record   (EHR)   system   that was   partially   upgraded,   with   some   departments   still   using legacy modules due   to budget constraints. The outpatient clinic managed its own scheduling and   billing systems, which were not fully integrated with the main hospital’s IT infrastructure.   This   siloed   setup   caused   data   synchronization   issues   and   created   additional   attack   vectors.   The   research   facility   conducted   sensitive   clinical   trials   and   stored   valuable   intellectual   property.   It   utilized   cutting-edge   technology   but   also   maintained   older   systems   for   long-term   data   storage,   creating   a   patchwork   of   security   levels.   The   data   center   was   the   hub   of MIHS’s   IT   operations,   housing   critical   servers   and   databases. While equipped with advanced security measures, it was not   immune to   vulnerabilities   due   to the legacy systems   connected to   it.
MIHS   had   implemented   a   Bring   Your   Own   Device   (BYOD)   policy,   allowing   staff   to   access   the   network    using    personal    devices.    This    policy    aimed      to      enhance      flexibility      and      convenience      but introduced   additional security   risks   due   to   the   potential   for   unpatched   vulnerabilities   and   insecure   configurations   on personal   devices.   Furthermore,   the   hospital's   cybersecurity   awareness   and   training   programs   had   not   reached   all   staff   members, leaving   a   significant   portion   of   the   workforce   unaware   of potential threats and   best practices for data   protection. This lack of   awareness created a human element   vulnerability that could be leveraged by attackers. On   the   morning   of June    15,   2023,   the   IT   department   was   inundated   with   alerts   indicating   a   major   security incident. Critical systems   began to malfunction, and it soon became clear that MIHS   was   under   a   full-scale   cyberattack.   The   attackers   had   successfully   infiltrated   the   hospital's   network,   exploiting   vulnerabilities   in   both   the   upgraded   and   legacy   systems.   They   deployed   sophisticated   ransomware,   encrypting sensitive data across the network and holding it hostage for   ransom.The   attack   had   immediate   and   severe   repercussions.   The   emergency   department   was   forced   to   close   due   to   the   inability   to   access   patient   records,   disrupting   critical   care   and   forcing   ambulances   to   be   rerouted to other facilities. Elective surgeries were postponed, leaving patients in a state of   uncertainty   and distress. The outpatient clinic faced chaos as   appointment   schedules   became   inaccessible,   causing   confusion and delays.Beyond   the   operational   disruptions,   the   attackers   claimed   to   have   stolen   confidential   patient   data,   incl代 写INTE2584 Introduction to Cybersecurity Governance Assessment 1: Cyber security Risk Assessment and ControlStatistics

They   threatened to   expose   or   sell this   data   on   the   dark web,   causing widespread   panic   among patients   and   eroding their trust in MIHS.MIHS    faced    a    multi-million    dollar    financial    burden,    encompassing    the    ransom      demand,      system   restoration   costs,   legal   fees,   and   potential   regulatory   fines.   The   hospital's   reputation   was   severely   damaged, with   patients questioning the security of   their health information and seeking care elsewhere.   The   incident   served   as   a   stark   reminder   of the   vulnerabilities   inherent   in   modern   healthcare   systems   and the devastating consequences of   a successful cyberattack.
